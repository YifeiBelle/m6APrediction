\title{Encode DNA Sequences into a Factor-Based Data Frame}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector where each element is a DNA sequence.
It is crucial that all sequences in the vector have the same length.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` where each row corresponds to an input DNA sequence.
  The columns are named `nt_pos1`, `nt_pos2`, etc., representing each
  position in the sequence.
}
\description{
This function is a preprocessing utility that converts a character vector of
equal-length DNA sequences (e.g., k-mers) into a data frame suitable for
use in machine learning models. Each position in the sequence is transformed
into a separate column, and the nucleotide at that position is represented
as a factor with predefined levels ("A", "T", "C", "G"). This ensures
consistent encoding for model training and prediction.
}
\examples{
# Example with a vector of 5-mers
sequences <- c("GGACA", "ATTGC", "CCTAG")
encoded_data <- dna_encoding(sequences)

# View the structure of the output
str(encoded_data)

# View the first few rows
head(encoded_data)
}
