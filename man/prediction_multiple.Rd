\title{Predict m6A Modification Status for a Batch of Sites}
\usage{
prediction_multiple(ml_fit, feature_df, positive_threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ml_fit}{A pre-trained model object that has a `predict` method
(e.g., an object of class `randomForest`). The model must have been trained
on predictors with the same names and data types as those in `feature_df`.}

\item{feature_df}{A `data.frame` containing the feature data for the sites
to be predicted. It must include the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item `gc_content` (numeric)
  \item `RNA_type` (character or factor)
  \item `RNA_region` (character or factor)
  \item `exon_length` (numeric)
  \item `distance_to_junction` (numeric)
  \item `evolutionary_conservation` (numeric)
  \item `DNA_5mer` (character)
}}

\item{positive_threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. The probability
threshold for classifying a site as "Positive". Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
The original input `feature_df` with two new columns appended:
  \item{`predicted_m6A_prob`}{The predicted probability of the site being "Positive".}
  \item{`predicted_m6A_status`}{The final predicted class ("Positive" or "Negative") based on the threshold.}
}
\description{
This is the primary batch prediction function. It takes a pre-trained
machine learning model and a data frame of new candidate sites, then returns
the data frame augmented with prediction probabilities and final class predictions.

\examples{
# This is a conceptual example, as it requires a pre-trained model object.
# In a real use case, `my_rf_model` would be loaded from a file.
\dontrun{
# Load your pre-trained model
my_rf_model <- readRDS("path/to/your/rf_fit.rds")

# Create a data frame with new data to predict
new_data <- data.frame(
  gc_content = c(0.55, 0.45),
  RNA_type = c("mRNA", "lncRNA"),
  RNA_region = c("3'UTR", "intron"),
  exon_length = c(10, 15),
  distance_to_junction = c(5, 8),
  evolutionary_conservation = c(0.8, 0.1),
  DNA_5mer = c("GGACU", "AAUGC")
)

# Get predictions
results <- prediction_multiple(ml_fit = my_rf_model, feature_df = new_data)
print(results)
}
