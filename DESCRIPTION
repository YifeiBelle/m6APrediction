Description: 
    Provides a streamlined workflow for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) site 
    prediction from RNA sequences. This package includes functions for 
    encoding DNA k-mers into a machine learning-compatible format and 
    applying a pre-trained random forest model to predict m6A status for 
    both single sites and large batches of data. It is designed to support 
    research in epitranscriptomics.
